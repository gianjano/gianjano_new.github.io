Families\_Share was a H2020 project that offered a bottom-up solution to work/life balance by supporting families with childcare, parenting advice and after-school activities.
The project was implemented in 6 Pilot Cities (Bologna, Gyor, Kortrijk, Thessaloniki, Trento, Venice) in 4 countries and involved parents of children aged 3â€“11.
Within the project, <a href="https://www.families-share-toolkit.eu/">a mobile app and a set of toolkits</a> were co-design with parents and stakeholders in order to supporto social innovation and co-creation.
Besides the initial pilot cities, Families\_Share mobile application was also being used by Families to support the personnel families taking care of their children, even in the emergency situation due to Covid-19.
