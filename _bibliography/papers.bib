	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications have a strong impact on people’s lives worldwide. Therefore, an increasing number of professionals and academics are focusing on the development of AI education programs for K-12. Part of these programs is developed for formal educational settings, such as school classrooms, which are complex systems with several variables interwoven. The current study concentrates on the teachers’ perspective on the implementation of an AI education curriculum for middle schools located in disadvantaged areas of Europe. Given these premises, a particular focus is devoted to how AI education can foster inclusion and be more accessible. Feedback was gathered through 582 logbooks provided by educators, and an international focus group conducted at the end of the curriculum implementation. This information helped to understand educators’ points of view on the AI curriculum, investigating how these topics can stimulate reflections around inclusion and diversity.},

	abstract = {Learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a young age can help students become competent citizens able to move through our increasingly digital world with confidence and responsibility. This contribution presents a preliminary investigation in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, and Romania to understand middle school teachers’ perspective on how to best teach digital competencies for AI. It uses the Will, Skill, Tool model as a theoretical lens, and it aims to inform the design of educational content and online platforms to enable teachers to integrate AI education into their classroom. Through a human-centred design process – including focus groups and a survey – needs and requirements were identified for a supportive online educational platform that aids teachers in AI education. The research results showed a positive attitude towards AI education and high motivation to introduce AI-related content at school, which translates to a positive Will factor. Regarding the Skill factor, teachers seem to have a basic level of digital skills but low AI-related skills. No significant problems emerged regarding the availability of resources, but further research investigating whether the Tool factor is accounted for would be desirable. Based on the results, six design implications for a web-based educational platform on AI have been formulated: (i) provide the required basics; (ii) make it relevant; (iii) make it interactive and collaborative; (iv) keep everyone in the loop; (v) make it accessible; (vi) motivate the user. These implications are further discussed to extend computational thinking frameworks to incorporate AI-related concepts and perspectives.},

	abstract = {This paper presents key aspects that designers and Human–Computer Interaction practitioners might encounter when designing multimodal interaction for older adults, focusing on the trade-offs that might occur as part of the design process. The paper gathers literature on multimodal interaction and assistive technology, and describes a set of design challenges specific for older users. Building on these main design challenges, four trade-offs in the design of multimodal technology for this target group are presented and discussed. To highlight the relevance of the trade-offs in the design process of multimodal technology for older adults, two of the four reported trade-offs are illustrated with two user studies that investigate mid-air and speech-based interaction with a tablet device. The first study explores the design trade-offs related to redundant multimodal commands in older, middle-aged and younger adults, whereas the second one investigates the design choices related to the definition of a set of mid-air one-hand gestures and voice input commands for older adults. Further reflections highlight the design trade-offs that such considerations bring in the process, providing an overview of the design choices involved and of their potential consequences.},

abstract={Purpose The European H2020 Families_Share project aims at offering a grass-root approach and a co-designed platform supporting families for sharing time and tasks related to childcare, parenting, after-school and leisure activities and other household tasks. To achieve this objective, the Families\_Share project has been built on current practices which are already leveraging on mutual help and support among families, such as Time Banks, Social Streets and self-organizing networks of parents active at the neighbourhood level and seek to harness the potential of ICT networks and mobile technologies to increase the effectiveness of participatory innovation. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss the Families\_Share methodology and platform, as well as the results obtained by several partecipating communities in different European countries. Design/methodology/approach This paper discusses how the Families Share approach (CAPS project, Horizon 2020) is bringing the sharing economy to childcare. Families Share developed a co-caring approach and a co-designed digital welfare platform to support parents with sharing time and tasks related to childcare, after-school and leisure activities. Families Share conducted two iterative pilot experiments and related socio-economic evaluations in six European cities. More than 3,000 citizens were engaged in the co-design process through their local community organizations and more than 1,700 parents and children actively experimented with the approach by organizing collaborative childcare activities. The authors discuss the challenges and solutions of co-designing a socio-technical approach aimed at facilitating socially innovative childcare models, and how the Families Share approach, based on technology-supported co-production of childcare, may provide a new sustainable welfare model for municipalities and companies with respect to life\textendash\textendash work balance. Findings The authors discuss the challenges and solutions of co-designing a technological tool aimed at facilitating socially innovative childcare models, and how the Families Share approach may provide a new sustainable welfare model for municipalities and companies with respect to work\textendash life balance. Originality/value As a main difference with state-of-the-art proposals, Families\_Share is aimed to provide support to networks of parents in the organization of self-managed activities, this way being orthogonal with respect either to social-network functionalities or to supply and demand services. Furthermore, Families\_Share has been based on a participative approach for both the ICT platform and the overall structure.},

abstract={Does building a collaborative digital story lead to reduction of intergroup tension? Studies show that joint storytelling can help reach deeper levels of understanding through exposure to another group's narrative. We hypothesized that engagement in a collaborative digital storytelling task would lead to reductions of negative emotions and attitudes. In our study, dyads of Ethiopian and non-Ethiopian Israelis interacted via a unique digital platform that supports storytelling in a comics-like format aiming to reduce intergroup tension. Their responses to this task were measured before and after the joint activity. Findings showed a decrease in negative emotional states in intergroup contexts (STAI) between pre-and post-intervention for members of both groups, and a slight decrease in negative attitudes toward the out-group. In other words, joint-digital storytelling sessions lead groups in complex relations to be more likely to support engagement. This study has implications for the effect of contact on intergroup tension. © 2021},

abstract={The COVID-19 emergency has posed many challenges to the worldwide school system leading to school closures and massive adoption of distance education. These events affected not only the way education is delivered but also the overall school community's wellbeing and cohesion. In this paper, we present a playful education platform originally designed to promote sustainable mobility in schools that has been adapted to support distance learning and community engagement during the health emergency. In the original version of the platform, the home-school distances traveled by students with sustainable means contributed to the advancement of the whole class in a collective virtual trip associated with playful learning material. Conversely, in a revised version of the platform adapted to the new context, students could advance in the virtual trip by reporting the good deeds performed at home. Findings from 161 questionnaires completed by teachers, families, and students, as well as results from online workshops with students, and the analysis of log files at the end of the school year revealed the opportunities and limitations of converting a playful activity conceived for being experienced in class into an online activity to be completed at home. The results show that the adapted version contributed to the school community cohesion and provided a positive experience to all its members, even though it was not able to completely overcome the generalized feeling of isolation. This paper contributes to understanding the social value of collaborative and playful digital activities that involve the entire school community, showing how technology can impact education and support communities in times of crisis. © 2021 Owner/Author.},

abstract={The COVID-19 emergency and consequent lockdowns left many parents struggling to balance childcare and paid employment, exposing the crucial role of work-life balance policies and practices. As a consequence, co-production initiatives has seen a sharp rise, with the creation of many different grassroots activities, also related to childcare services. Although it is not clear whether these initiatives will continue after the pandemic, they provide an interesting laboratory to investigate digitally mediated co-production of services. This paper presents a case study of a grassroot initiative based on the co-production of childcare services within an organizational context. We report on how this initiative has been adapted during the COVID-19 emergency, discussing how the community of colleagues reacted to the new challenges of the pandemic, and the technological and organizational arrangements that have accompanied such changes. Results from interviews and focus groups revealed the mediating role that digital technology played in the co-production, presenting challenges and opportunities to working parents while dealing with a period of emergency and isolation. These findings suggest implications for organizations to promote remote collaborative childcare practices and support workers wellbeing and work-life balance, considering motivational and social aspects and the role of technology in fostering co-production practices. © 2021 ACM.},

The paper describes the design rationale of this approach, following the theory of auditory–visual integration, in terms of an automatic self-adaptable technique based on the reader's gaze that provides an individualized interaction experience. This tool has been assessed in a controlled experiment with 20 children (aged 8–10 years) with a diagnosis of dyslexia and a control group of 20 children with typical reading abilities. The results show that children with reading difficulties improved their comprehension scores by 24% measured on a standardized instrument for the assessment of reading comprehension and that children with more inaccurate reading (N = 9) tended to benefit more. The findings are discussed in terms of a better integration between audio and visual text information, paving the way to improve standard read-aloud technology with gaze-contingency and self-adaptable techniques to personalize the reading experience. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

In order to investigate these aspects, we develop a case study in a primary school in Italy. A class of 18 children and 2 teachers used a digital tool, named ComicsCLIL, with the aim of creating digital narratives in the CLIL framework. The results provide some evidences that comicbased digital storytelling can be a beneficial educational tool for approaching CLIL lessons. It emerged, in fact, that digital storytelling, as supported by ComicsCLIL, can facilitate this practice by being engaging, easy to use, fully educational while considering the collaborative aspect. © 2021 International Council for Educational Media.},

abstract={Joint narratives are often used in the context of reconciliation interventions for people in social conflict situations, which arise, for example, due to ethnic or religious differences. The interventions aim to encourage a change in attitudes of the participants towards each other. Typically, a human mediator is fundamental for achieving a successful intervention. In this work, we present an automated approach to support remote interactions between pairs of participants as they contribute to a shared story in their own language. A key component is an automated cognitive tutor that guides the participants through a controlled escalation/de-escalation process during the development of a joint narrative. We performed a controlled study comparing a trained human mediator to the automated mediator. The results demonstrate that an automated mediator, although simple at this stage, effectively supports interactions and helps to achieve positive outcomes comparable to those attained by the trained human mediator. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In particular, we focus on investigating three specific aspects: (1) the potential of digital story composition conducted collaboratively or individually, (2) the children's perception on the use of digital storytelling for reflecting on conflicts that might arise in class and, (3) the teachers' experience of introducing a digital tool for collaborative storytelling and comics composition in an educational context. In this paper, we explored these aspects by developing a case study. A class of 12 children and 2 teachers explore the use of a digital tool, named Communics, aimed at creating digital narratives individually and collaboratively. The results show that digital narratives created from collaborative storytelling are longer, more structured, and richer with meaning compared to stories from individual work. Moreover, it emerged that children prefer to work collaboratively, even if it meant compromising, going slower and waiting for their turn. Finally, teachers appreciated the collaborative use of Communics, and in particular, the turn-based feature as children can practice the narrative re-elaboration with a peer while waiting for their turn. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={This paper presents key aspects that designers and Human–Computer Interaction practitioners might encounter when designing multimodal interaction for older adults, focusing on the trade-offs that might occur as part of the design process. The paper gathers literature on multimodal interaction and assistive technology, and describes a set of design challenges specific for older users. Building on these main design challenges, four trade-offs in the design of multimodal technology for this target group are presented and discussed. To highlight the relevance of the trade-offs in the design process of multimodal technology for older adults, two of the four reported trade-offs are illustrated with two user studies that investigate mid-air and speech-based interaction with a tablet device. The first study explores the design trade-offs related to redundant multimodal commands in older, middle-aged and younger adults, whereas the second one investigates the design choices related to the definition of a set of mid-air one-hand gestures and voice input commands for older adults. Further reflections highlight the design trade-offs that such considerations bring in the process, providing an overview of the design choices involved and of their potential consequences. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Multimodal human–computer interaction has been sought to provide not only more compelling interactive experiences, but also more accessible interfaces to mobile devices. With the advance in mobile technology and in affordable sensors, multimodal research that leverages and combines multiple interaction modalities (such as speech, touch, vision, and gesture) has become more and more prominent. This article provides a framework for the key aspects in mid-air gesture and speech-based interaction for older adults. It explores the literature on multimodal interaction and older adults as technology users and summarises the main findings for this type of users. Building on these findings, a number of crucial factors to take into consideration when designing multimodal mobile technology for older adults are described. The aim of this work is to promote the usefulness and potential of multimodal technologies based on mid-air gestures and voice input for making older adults’ interaction with mobile devices more accessible and inclusive.

abstract={Child independent mobility (CIM) refers to the freedom and capability of children to move about their local neighborhoods without constant direct adult supervision. Our climb project combats an observed decline in CIM, offering a pervasive gameful platform for home-school mobility composed of three primary components: the first two using technology to support different levels of child independence and the third providing an element of continuous motivation for positive behavior change. This paper describes these three novel technologies: PedibusSmart, SafePath, and KidsGoGreen, and reports on four years of success with more than 1800 elementary age children, their teachers, and families. We further show how (i), disappearing, pervasive technology contributes to successful adoption, (ii), properly balancing trust and tracking leads to useful, noninvasive technological support, and (iii), in-classroom, gameful technology engages and motivates participation, with behavior changes persisting over time. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

In a first phase, focus groups with NGO operators were organized for negotiating the goals and the boundaries of the intervention. Then, semi-structured interviews with migrants were conducted to define both graphical and textual content on which to base the storytelling activity. In a second phase, we conducted a pilot study with young adult male migrants aimed at investigating the storytelling experience as a reflective process. The empirical findings provide evidence that digital storytelling based on comics can facilitate the narration practice and indications for future development of Communics.

Based on a school-year long field study, we report findings on children’s and parents’ experience with proximity detection devices. The results provide insights into how the parents and children accepted and socially appropriated the technology into the walking school bus activity, shedding light on the way they understand and conceptualize a technology that collects data on children’s proximity to the volunteers’ smartphone. We discuss parents’ needs and concerns around monitoring technologies and the related challenges in terms of trust-control balance.

This paper presents a case study of an online deliberation initiative involving the discussion of a contentious internal policy within an organisation of around 550 knowledge workers. The deliberation process lasted 5 weeks and actively involved 167 employees. Different sources of information (user interaction logs, activity patterns, questionnaire responses) were analysed to investigate the impact of participation, or non-participation, on the level of satisfaction with the deliberation, and on the understanding of the issue discussed. The findings suggest that (1) interest is a driver for participation, but it does not explain active participation, (2) participation, either active or passive, positively influences the understanding of the issue and (3) satisfaction with the outcome is not related to participation, but it may support participation in future initiatives. © 2019 Brian Towers (BRITOW) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

In the class game, stretches of distance travelled in a sustainable way by each child contributes to the advancement of the whole school on a collective virtual trip. During the trip, several virtual stops are associated with the discovery of playful learning material. The approach has been evaluated in a primary school with 87 pupils and 6 teachers actively involved in the learning activity for 12 continuous weeks. The findings from the questionnaires with parents and the interviews with teachers show a positive effect in terms of children’s behavioural change as well as educational value.

abstract={Since they can integrate a wide range of interactive modalities, multimodal interfaces are considered to improve accessibility for a variety of users, including older adults. However, only few works have actually explored how older adults approach multimodal interaction outside specific contexts and have done so mainly in comparison to much younger users. This study explores how older (65+ years old), middle-aged (55-65 years old) and younger adults (25-35 years old) use mobile multimodal interaction in an everyday activity (i.e. taking photos with a tablet) by using midair gestures and voice commands, and investigates the differences and similarities between the considered age groups. Preliminary findings from a video-analysis show that all groups easily combine the proposed modalities when interacting with a tablet device. Furthermore, compared to younger adults, older and middle-aged adults show similarities in the way they perform gesture and voice commands. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

We report the results of a 9-month study conducted within a living lab that involved 96 customers of a large retail store. The analysis of usage logs and patterns of behaviour show different user categories: constant, sprinter and casual users. A survey was conducted to compare those categories as far as demographics, personality traits and usability metrics are concerned. Ten follow-up interviews further investigated motivations behind different usage patterns.

abstract={Drawing on concepts from theories on persuasion, social psychology, and philosophy of language, this article presents the design of an ambient persuasive system that acts as an automatic facilitator by supporting a balanced flow of communication in group conversational activity. The system includes two main components: (a) a context-awareness system that monitors group member non-verbal behavior, and (b) a visualization component that promotes balanced participation, providing targeted directives to participants through peripheral displays. In two empirical studies, a strategy for influencing participant social dynamics based on subtle directives in the form of aesthetically pleasant visual animations was assessed. The findings provide insight on the effect, the acceptability, and the perceived influence of subtle peripheral persuasive messages for ambient displays. The studies indicate that when the participants understand the message intention, the subtle directives have a positive influence on group behavior, and are considered more appealing and less intrusive than overt, language-based messages. Furthermore, it was found that personality traits influenced attitudes towards the system. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Children with reading difficulties face several obstacles in learning to fluently read written material. Multimedia applications integrating text-to-speech (TTS) synthesisers are valuable tools for supporting reading activities. The paper presents GARY, an application that combines TTS synthesis with eye tracking. GARY is meant to be used on a tablet device coupled with an eye tracker. Making use of the information from reader's eye movement, the system allows users to adapt the speed rate of the synthesised voice to their pace of reading. The paper describes the system, its functioning and future steps in designing a tool for supporting readers' ability in making the connection between the sounds heard and the letters read. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper we present the evaluation of an application for the collaborative composition of comics using a pre-defined set of images and sentences. This study is an intermediate step to guide the design of a tablet application for supporting collaborative storytelling between two authors from different cultures and speaking different languages. For this purpose, we assessed the effectiveness of a constrained-text approach for comic composition in which sentences are selected from a library rather than written by the authors. Our results show that the constrained-text approach provides a satisfying form of co-narration, stimulating the authors to stay on topic, while using the available narrative material. The findings of this study have implications for the future design of collaborative storytelling applications for multilingual and cross-cultural scenarios. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.},

Our goal was to investigate the effectiveness and the satisfaction of use of such an approach in comparison to a less constrained one. This pilot study is meant as an initial step to inform the design of a tool to support teenagers who speak different languages to remotely create collaborative stories. Initial results are encouraging, since they suggest that the limitation of expressiveness imposed by the pre-defined sentences do not hinder the possibility of creating sensible and creative stories.

An interest estimation algorithm based on the analysis of the users’ non-verbal behaviour, including the users’ position, their orientation and the social context, is proposed. A preliminary field study suggests that an adaptive public display may be more appealing than a control condition, where the same content is offered without any adaptation. We argue that behavioural-based measures are valuable data to inform and adapt a public display in a social-aware way, improving the users’ engagement.},

abstract={Providing a common place for the civil society to gather and discuss topics of mutual interest is a growing challenge for social and collaborative computing. Web-based tools for civic engagement, while promising, are still disconnected from meaningful physical locations where citizens usually meet and might limit the involvement of a considerable portion of the citizen population. We propose a system, Agora2.0, designed to recover the useful function that public places have had in the past in promoting and regulating citizens' participation in public decisions. Agora2.0 is inspired by the old concept of the Greek agora, or public square. It is composed of an onsite interactive public display and an online site. We present the project, the analysis of the requirements, the system prototype, and its evaluation during deployments in a university and in a public relations office of a European city.},

abstract={Tabletops are commonly used for collaboration but would benefit from features that help orient objects to individual users disposed around the display. We propose an approach of automatic orientation based on fingers and hand detection as a proxy to determine the position of the user. To contribute to the discussion of the relevance of automatic rotation, we present a comparison study of pairs of participants engaged in both loosely and tightly coupled tasks. We collected performance measures, questionnaires and analyze interactions from video recordings. The results show that automatic rotation is more suitable when the collaboration is loosely coupled. Conversely, in tightly coupled tasks performance are worse and user ratings low when automatic rotations are enabled. We conclude that features such as automatic orientation on tabletop are important and promising but that they need to be critically assessed with respect to their effects on collaboration in both tightly and loosely coupled tasks.},
