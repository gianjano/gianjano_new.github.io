I am a User Experience (Ux) researcher with a background in psychology, currently researcher at <a href="https://www.fbk.eu/en/">Fondazione Bruno Kessler â€“ FBK</a>. I received my PhD in Cognitive Science from CIMeC â€“ Center for Mind/Brain Science â€“ University of Trento (Italy) and my MSc in Experimental Psychology from the University of Padova (Italy).

My research centers on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), focusing on the design, development, and evaluation of collaborative, social, and accessible technologies. 

At present, my research focuses on the integration of HCI and artificial intelligence to explore critical issues surrounding AI literacy and human-AI interaction. As our society becomes increasingly reliant on AI-enabled systems, it is crucial to investigate how individuals perceive, trust, and interact with these systems. My research aims to develop innovative AI-enabled technologies that promote human learning, equity, and social inclusion.
